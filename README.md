This is a module to align annotations from multiple human annotators. Using annotations can be
extremely helpful for creating highly descriptive [forward encoding models] (https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17637) for analyzing brain data, especially when highly [naturalistic stimuli] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26980615) are employed in experimental paradigms. Thisis work in progress, as project for [Psyc161] (https://github.com/dartmouth-pbs/psyc161) taught at PBS, Dartmouth by [Yaroslav Halchenko] (http://centerforopenneuroscience.org/)
